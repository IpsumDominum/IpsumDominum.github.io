  	            <p><strong>What is the role of intelligence in the universe? Why has it came about?</strong></p>
                <p>What is intelligence?</p>
                <p>We distinguish life and things which are non-living in this universe by the fact that the latter cannot manipulate it's surrounding and is passive to change.</p>
                <p>Intelligent beings on the other hand are like blackholes for energy, we destroy things around us which are in order, in order to maintain our own order.</p>
                <p>How has it came about, fundamentally>?</p>
                <p>Perhaps it is through evolution that our bodies became capable of enviornmental manipulation and our brains capable of establishing and manipulating precise and robust internal representations.</p>
                <p>But how did evolution come to start?</p>

                <p>Perhaps first there was certain stable states of which matter would come together and stay in, as analogous to Conway's game of life. Then it happend to be that the matter would eventually become unstable, due to the constant influence of external influence and deteriate. Some, for instance, rocks, would simply deteriate. But perhaps there was some intricate construction of a particular stable state which, when it had started to fall apart, instead it comes to a natural second stable state, which it separates to replications of itself. This then happens recursively. For some reason, it turned out that this process eventually became more and more efficient: "genes", and along withit a set of mechanism to decode it became the next stable state, and so on.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>This perhaps suggests that the fact that evolution exists as a possibility is not just a cosmic coincidence, but rather completely dependent on the set of physical rules which governs our universe. There must be a direct causation of evolution being the next stable state, based on our physical laws.</p>
                <p>This perhaps suggests that other life must exist within the same domain of our universe. And also perhaps intelligence is the step board now to the ultimate stable state of matter, and perhaps any intelligent system can possibly have the chance of becoming capable of manipulating it's own life itself and achieve controled immortality</p>
                <p>(note that this is different to say the naked mole rat, where it does not have control over it's immortality.)</p>
