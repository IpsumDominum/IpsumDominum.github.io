<h1>Poems on the train</h1>
<pre>
1.
Step,step, step the rain,
with its tippy-toe, silently stepping.

Moon covered the faces of dark clouds,

and you, like a bird of passage, 
exhausted by day,
eagerly early to your slumber.

2.
Hair is growing longer now.
Thin strands of fibre dripping under the force of gravity.
They start to cover my eyes.

My hair is growing longer now,
they reach the tip of my fingers,
a band of hooligans,
they crawl underneath my feet.

Until one day, like a cocoon,
My hair wraps me up from behind,
and from there I start to see the world muffled.

3.
The sun scorch the side of my face,

I wake.

In the morning everything changed,
from titanium battleship to durian smelling tropical islands,
covered in grey eye-lashes, and broken sea-turtle shells.

Was it a dream?

I grab the curtain, looking for air,

But all i see is silence.

4.
Quietly, leaves fall, sun seared marks on exposed veins.

Silently, You spoke of shadows, how they follow you in soft footsteps,
like old English majordomos, never disappoint.

Quickly, leaves flooded the floor, but then they began to rise,
they rose like a ball of sardines, like a swarm of baffled bees.

Rising, rising, to consume, and to be consumed.

Silently still, you asked me not <i>too</i> worry, 
your tender fingers left a dimgray dip onto my lips.

So I closed my eyes, and allowed for the consumption.

Quietly, We are consumed.

Me and you, on a stone bench top somewhere else in true shore.
