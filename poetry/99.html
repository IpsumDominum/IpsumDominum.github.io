        <pre>
There is something with Mr.Kale.
Recently, his face is turning pale.
like ashes burning in a jar of cigarrette remains.

No amount of caffeine,
Nor alchohol can sooth him. It wouldn't go away.

But what is it?,
Mr.Kale, now cross legged,
reclining on a recliner.

Then he remembered, he used to sang,
spend days on branches of kurrajong, 
composing long poems, diphthong, folk's tongue.

But what is it?,
Mr Kale, now hunched over,
hovering a field of galingale.

Then he remembered, he used to swim,
purring hot flames in swales of underswell.
In whimsey white wit, whispered words of tattletales.

But what is it?!

When the evening came to an end,
Dask dyed canvas red.

Mr Kale, now found himself lost,
meandering on ocean waves.


The wind hurled him into waters. 
Falling like a swampish sewer,
He heard deceased sailors,
shouting sea shanties,

whales, dugong, shellfish mistaken,
for jewel. 

Shadows chased his shoes.

At last he shut his eyes, and let the night sigh.

From his finger tips. thoughts flung.
