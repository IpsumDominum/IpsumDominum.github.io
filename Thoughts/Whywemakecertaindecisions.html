    <h4>Why we make certain decisions<h4>
    <p class="lead">Why do we like something, and not. 
Why do we make a certain decision, and not another. <br><br>

We look for a path of thought in our mind which "feels" most 
smooth and acceptable, to which we make our decisions. <br><br>

The accept or not feeling is the anticipated reward or
threat. <br><br>
This can be an internal reward/threat (morality,self principles)
or external (pain,comfort)
though it is a balance of two which guides our actions ultimately.
For instance a mother can withstand great pain to save their
child, since she senses the potential threat feeling of losing
her child to be too great, and the reward for being able to 
save her child large.<br><br>

For instance Fatty food becomes delicious when we associate it 
with the "supposed good taste"(or the image of a person happily
eating a pizza, on an advertisement, or how other people say it
is delicious)
and it becomes disgusting when we think
about how it feels in our stomatch afterwards, and the lack
of energy we experience/ loss of fitness.<br><br>

Our world is created due to our narration, we give our world
a story.<br> In this story we are the main character, our decisions
all have reasons, if there is a decision or something we have 
done which goes against our rules for how we should behave,
we consider that thing which we had done embarrassing, or
a mistake, which we should learn to not to do again in the future.<br><br>

Our stories are intertwined with other people's stories, and it
is established from the story of the society, most importantly,
the story goes: I am xxx(name), I am (identity, perhaps a student,
a person with 19 years old, etc), I was (past), I am now(future,
goals).<br><br>

Although, we are constantly changing our story as we go. We call
our past story that we have changed from "our naive self", and
we are constantly trying to do things hoping that in the future
we could transition from our "present self" to a "future" and 
better self. This is our ambition, whether to become some
other social status -"a doctor, a nobel price winnning scientist etc"
or perhaps "in a home with a car and a family living happily".</p>
