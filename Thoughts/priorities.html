                <h4><strong>How to prioritise when there are so many things to learn.</strong><h4>

                    <p>How do we make priorities when there are too many things to study.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>There just seems to be infinite amount of things which we can learn in this world. Obviously we cannot possibly learn everything. So we must learn what is important.</p>
                    <p>We must first understand our goals. Each person is influenced by their past to be interested in different things and have different visions for what they ought to become in the future.</p>
                    <p>After understanding what our goal is, we have to set several criterions to evaluate what is the most important to study for us now.</p>
                    <p>1.The basics. For any field, from film making to building a space industry, there are always certain fundamentals, which the past people have layed out when they tread out the first paths. For instance, basic algebra is required before you may understand calculus, which is required before you can understand machine learning.</p>
                    <p>2.The inspirings. Everything in the world is connected, so anything everything can be used as a source of inspiration of thought. There are countless examples to where seemingly completely disjoint ideas ended up supporting each other. These knowledege we should always be learning, when we are tired of 1.3.4</p>
                    <p>3.The tools. For any field there will be tools that we just need to familiarise ourselves with. This could be learning a programming language, or a text editor like emacs.Or perhaps familiarising yourself with a soldering iron.You could say 1. is another form of tools, except it is a special type of tools, tools of theory.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>4.The principles. To get to any goal, there are certain theories and thoughts which are key. If you are a translator, then lingustics will be these principles. If you are a film maker, it is the theory of film. These principles should be unexhaustable, you should be able to keep on understanding it better and better, and learning these will take you eventually towards your goal and vision.</p>
                    <p>When you get stuck and realize that you cannot understand the principles enough, go back to the basics. When you run out of ideas, go get some inspirations. When you feel like your learning or process of trial and error can be made more efficient, learn to master the tools.</p>
