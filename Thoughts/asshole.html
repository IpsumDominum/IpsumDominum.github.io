                    <p>What makes a person an asshole?</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Ultimately we are all selfish. Everything that we do are either an internal or external reward, or to get away from</p>
                    <p>internal or external punishment.</p>
                    <p>However, within a society, we need other people's approval, it constitutes as an external reward. Also, we need other people's willingness to help us. Therefore we must not always be selfish, and consider for other people's needs and wants in the short run.</p>
                    <p>What makes a person an asshole, is when a person disregards these social rules which makes the society&nbsp;harmonious. When a person decides that they do not need to care for the approval of another person and solely considers both short term and long term goals to be of the benefit of themselves. Then we have nothing to say but call them an asshole. One which is excluded from our trust, or willingness to help.</p>
                    <p>But the biggest of assholes, are those who only act without short term selfishness expecting an immediate or guarenteed return of favor from those who they had already forcefully appied their "grace" to. The difference here is that normal socialization involves respecting the other people's concious decisions, the favor that is given does not need to be reciprecated.(Some people may claim that they do not do anything expecting any return, in this case either the return is fully internal, such that they feel that they have done a good deed and it is God or fate which will reward them, or they are just trying to avoid doing what they think only an asshole would do. Either case, we can see that if overtime favors are continously not reciprecated, the receiver is then also distrusted and becomes an asshole as well.)</p>
                    <p>The biggest of assholes claim that they love certain people, claim that they care for them. But they do things which are hurtful and inconsiderate of those very people they tell others or themselves they want to protect.</p>
                    <p>They do not understand love. They do not understand themselves. They have failed to recognize their inherent bias towards seeing themselves as the main character of the world and their decisions to be the most righeous.</p>
                    <p>The reason for a person to be an asshole could be many. Perhaps it is determined genetically.</p>
                    <p>Or perhaps it is upbringing,perhaps when a child has their happiness tied in appearance to their parents happiness, the child will subconciously believe that as long as their wish is fufilled, everyone will be happy. This stays subconciously even with the adult. Or perhaps when a person stops trusting others, from being traumatised by an experience of abandonment. Or perhaps it is just due to ignorance and immaturity where experience will fix the asshole.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately we are all assholes, we all remember the time where we had been one and we have all learnt our own lessons of how not to be an asshole and how to be liked by other people. Even those who had always put pleasing others to be their first priority, in secret they fantasize about being an asshole or themselves pleased as someone elses priority.</p>
