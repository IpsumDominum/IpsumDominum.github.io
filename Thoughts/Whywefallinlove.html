    <h4><strong>What leads to two people having a relationship of any kind</strong><h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We meet so many people in our lives which we will never meet again.</p>
<p>But when we die we would have had some people who had became important to us in our lives, they are our friends and enemies,we will remember their names, and we will remember how we have interacted with them over our lives.</p>
<p>So what makes one person important and another person not?</p>
<p>What is the reason why we like some people and not others?</p>
<p>We have a personal relationship with our family because theywere there from the beginning, we have already formed arelationship with them back when we did not have the choice to.</p>
<p>We make friends when we can comfortably accept them in our story of our lives without comprimising our own.For people who's lives are dominated by the social norm, this is&nbsp;the reason why they would not make friends who are abnormal.For people who dominate over their own lives, this is the reasonwhy they would not make friends with those who are too clingy.</p>
<p>Friendships happen because of common interests, of good conversations, and mutual respect. They happen gradually as more memories are shared together and more the two people learn about each other. It then becomes support for both people, and after all, knowing that someone likes you is often a good feeling.</p>
<p>We cannot befriend those which we belive are in a different, or even worse a contradicting world view to us. It becomes tiring to try to pretend that we are agreeing with them, to avoid conflict.</p>
<p>(unless if we realize that. disagreement doesn't nessasarily have to mean conflict, but unfortunately most people believes for it is)</p>
<p>When friendships break, we avoid confronting the other person and often slowly let them drift out of our lives.</p>
<p><strong>Sexual attraction brings people together.</strong> When we see someone on the street that gives us butterflies in the stomatch, we want to know them better.</p>
<p>Many people justifies their sexual wants for another person to say that they love them. We don't feel "right" to admit that we are sexual animals for the reasons</p>
<p>But love is not sexual attraction, love is simply a trusting and enhanced level of friendship but one that we know we can be vulnerable in as we know the partner's worst forms and they know ours.</p>
<p><strong>Respect brings people together.</strong></p>
<p>We want to make friends with people who we believe has got clues to how we can achieve certain things that we would like to achieve in our own lives.</p>
<p><strong>The process of bringing two people together</strong></p>
<p>Getting to know someone is like trying to tame a cat.</p>
<p>If you go too quickly and too aggressively the cat runs away.</p>
<p>You have to let the cat come to you.</p>
<p>Ultimately people are not objects which we manipulate, we must give room for them to also act according to their free will. And this is in fact an act of respect.</p>
<p>Though sometimes we know everything but make mistakes anyway.<p>
