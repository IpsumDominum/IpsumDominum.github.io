    <h4>Fear and Control<h4>
    <p class="lead">What is fear.
<strong>
We fight the enemies, the threats.
We fear the unknown,the uncontrolable.</strong><br><br>

The deep oceans, the fall from a high cliff,
the glaring eyes of the swimmingpool drain through the 
smirky waters.<br><br>

We fear the dreams we cannot escape and we fear the people
who chase us.<br><br>
Fear becomes anger and frustration when we try to take
control.<br><br>

We want control.<br><br>

Without control we are not human.<br>
The basis of us, is that we continously,(conciously or not
conciously), form goals short and long term (from raising a hand
to grab a tooth brush or wanting to build a company which 
organizes resources, talented engineers, build factories and 
produces spacecrafts.)<br><br>

We can only accomplish these goals if we have control.
Control means we know the consequences of our actions.
In other words we know how our actions influences the enviornment,
the enviornment can be anything from the positions of the
toothbrush on the shelf, to the dynamics of the society.<br><br>

If something interferes with that control we would naturally 
oppose it. We don't like obligations, and we shouldn't,
we should make our decisions. This is why goal driven people
who plan their lives do not like attached friends,and 
make friends with those who they control, or rather, have
confidence in predicting their behaviour, and the interactions
with them are without obligations.<br><br>

We don't like people who are dillusioned, religious people,
hippies or conspiracy theorists,<br><br>
It is tiring to have a conversation with them,
It is tiring because we don't want to say anything to 
dissagree with them nor do we accept their reality, since
our logic points to beliefs otherwise.
because we don't want to change people, or change ourselves.<br><br>

We don't like to hurt other people, we don't want to intend
any harm. It hurts us more when we hurt others.
Though sometimes if needed we can have the iron will to do 
anything. <br><br>

When a person chases us too close, we have to guess what they
want from us, we don't know how to respond.<br><br>

When we don't know how to respond we run away, we defend,
we shut ourselves out and others out.<br><br>
We ignore, we pretend and we change our stories.
