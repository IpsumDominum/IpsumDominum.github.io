No matter what profession or hobby we may choose to dedicate their time to. <br/>

** Our time is limited.** <br/>
This is why we must choose wisely, onto what projects we
must devote our time to. <br/>
Talking about failures is a difficult task, No one really wants
to share a story to others which may give an impression that
you, the person who can and should be trusted, actually can't
be trusted at all times, because **you fail.
