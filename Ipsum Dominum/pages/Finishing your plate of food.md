 "Life is limited. but the service to the people is infinite" --- Lei Feng```
No matter what profession or hobby we may choose to dedicate their time to. <br/>
** Our time is limited.** <br/>
This is why we must choose wisely what projects we dedicate ourselves to, in this
limited amount of time, not only drawn from the reservoir of our current day, week
but also just seconds and hours which will never return from the entirety of our lives.
<br/>

Recently I started to make another website,I made a reasonable skeleton in a day, and it looked nice. but I felt something wrong: It was done over an entire day of time from start to finish, 8 hours of total time working.<br/>
It begs the question: **How efficient was the time spent, and how much learning have I made throughout the process
which will benefit me in the future?** <br/>
I realised a few things:<br/>
> 1. A professional web developer with high experience would have been able to make the same site within 1 hour, or less, written much fewer and much more secure code, and easily scale it up to new features and continued integration in the future.<br/>
> 2. (this is immediately followed by 1.) Had I spent 2-4 hours of the total time spent making this website,
on furthering my experience with css, javascript, and had spent more time learning about the alternative higher level abstractions (Pug,haml,less,react etc). I would have not only gained much more efficiency in future web development abilities,but also possibly could have then only required 4 hours, to build the same website<br/>
> 3. I am spending too much time building websites. To everyone I know, I babbel about how I think web developing is just carpentry and design, with intellectual value burried only deep underneath layers of abstraction and obfuscated with protocols and historical baggage. But I have spent the majority of my time, in the past 2 months or so, writing javascript, and making web applications/websites.<br/>
> 4. Most importantly, I finished working on none of these websites, which I had started.<br/>


Specifically, I worked on:

 A website for the university [Go Club](otagogo.club)<br/>
 A platform for shops to create QR code based reward programmes(abandoned on my part and taken offline)<br/>
Two Html/javascript browser games. One created from [this online tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSwUOBL1YQ) and another which is a [scroll shooter game](http://revengeofsuhaib.herokuapp.com/).<br/>
A website for [finding flats in my local city](http://139.162.7.217)<br/>
 A [Python application](https://github.com/IpsumDominum/OCRbox) for quickly setting up screen location specific OCR watching processes.<br/>
 A [static site generator](https://ipsumdominum.github.io/Ipsum%20Dominum/html/pyblogger.html) (the one that generates this)<br/>
A website for [finding recipes](http://www.simplerewardz.com), based on local ingredients, in my local city.<br/>

And a common theme started to emerge: <br/>
I vastly underestimated the amount of time and effort required to under take each of these projects,and instead of learning by principles, I learned through iteration and mistake, which meant much less generalization, and much less time:result ratio.<br/>
(In fact this blog is not finished... )<br/>
(you can check the website out at:[www.simplerewardz.com](http://www.simplerewardz.com),the domain is actually not related to the content,the domain was originally registered to host another project, now abandoned on my part.)
