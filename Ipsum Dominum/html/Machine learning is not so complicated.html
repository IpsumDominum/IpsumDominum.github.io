<p>Almost everybody has heard about "Machine learning" as a hot phrase being thrown around everywhere.
Everyone I talk to these days nodds when I say I study machine learning, and say umm that's where the money is at.
While whether machine learning is really going to be the next electricity,is another question. But I think it's fair to say that there is a huge amount of interest, by many new recruits to the machine learning cult, on actually learning what the heck this crazy thing is that has in recent years taken so much of the world's attention.Having large cooperations like googligoogle, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China">big governments</a> put billions of dollars into research.</p>
<p>This is mainly driven by the fact that deep learning,a particular model of the many models of machine learning(Although I would argue that in principle there's not much variation between one machine learning model to another.), can produce some measurable results, and easily communicated to non-scientists who has actually got the rhinos in their pockets.</p>
<p>Because of the lack of an upperbound for just how much deep learning can achieve,or a good measurement, it is possible for it to go vastly uncritisized, for many members of expertise or non-expertise, to go out and tell everybody just how great this technique is, and just how much it can solve incredible problems.</p>
<p>Now, so far it seems to be that I am being judgemental about how much machine learning can achieve. That's not what I'm trying to say here, I'm just trying to say that the ability of deep learning is vastly limited, given the way it is approached in general at this moment. Further theory is required to be developed, and I'm talking about beyond statistical learning theory and kernels, we gotta stop thinking about kernels, In my own opinion.</p>
