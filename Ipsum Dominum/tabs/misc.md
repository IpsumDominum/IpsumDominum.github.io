|                |    Speed                      |Simplicity                   |Utility|Popularity|packagemanager | 
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------|----|---|
|C               |fast            |medium           | Pretty good, doesn't have a massive confusing web of libraries to learn, but can mean you have to implement your own solutions          |  ok  | not so good|
|C++          |fast            |medium              | Lower level, controlling hardware,backend for engines(game engines,etc) and compute frameworks(tensorflow etc)  | highish  | not so good
|`Python`          |slow|simple|Pretty good, source of interface for a lot of open source projects, Open BCI, open AI gym, etc etc etc.      |      high      |   pretty good|
|JavaScript          |slow|simple| Pretty much mostly the web, can be used to do other things, but javascript is not really the most well designed language...     |  high |    pretty good|
|  Java     |fast|simple|     Pretty good, Android development etc, all kinds of things run java, but getting out of date and the package manager sucks...             |  medium |  pretty good

Professor Peter Norvig on python: "I was trying to find a language that could most resemble my pseudo code and be intuitive for my students, and it turned out that python was basically my pseudo code"
`Python` is Simple, compact,and well supported, it is useful for many things and really great  as a language for non-programmers.
